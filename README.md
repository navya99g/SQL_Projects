## üìå **About This Repository**  
This repository contains multiple SQL case studies where I have performed:  
‚úÖ Data Exploration  
‚úÖ Joins & Aggregations  
‚úÖ Window Functions  
‚úÖ CTEs & Subqueries  
‚úÖ Performance Optimization  

Each case study includes real-world datasets and structured SQL queries to solve business problems.

## üìÇ **Case Studies Overview**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Case Study 1: Sales Performance Analysis](./CaseStudy1.sql)**
- **Objective**: Analyzing sales data to identify top-performing products and trends.  
- **Dataset**: `Sales`, `Customers`, `Products`  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Identified best-selling products using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.  
  - Used `JOINs` to merge sales and customer data.  
  - Applied `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` to rank products by revenue.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Case Study 2: Customer Segmentation](./CaseStudy2.sql)**
- **Objective**: Understanding customer behavior based on purchase frequency.  
- **Dataset**: `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Used `CASE WHEN` to categorize customers into High, Medium, and Low spenders.  
  - Applied `CTEs` for step-wise analysis of customer orders.  
  - Identified repeat customers using `COUNT()` and `HAVING`.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Case Study 3: Employee Performance Dashboard](./CaseStudy3.sql)**
- **Objective**: Evaluating employee sales performance.  
- **Dataset**: `Employees`, `Sales`, `Regions`  
- **Key Insights**:  
  - Calculated total sales per employee using `SUM()`.  
  - Used `RANK()` to determine top performers in each region.  
  - Implemented `CASE` conditions to classify employees as high, medium, or low performers.
